# LIRI

This app was created in order to hone my skills with nodejs and the command line.

To use the app type in the command line 'node liri.js' followed by one of four commands:
spotify-this-song
concert-this
movie-this
do-what-it-says

Follow up the first three commands with the song, artist/band, or movie that you would like information on. The last command will take whatever instructions are in the 'random.txt' file and execute them.
